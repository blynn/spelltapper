<string name="town0">Welcome to Spell Tap!\n[Tap the screen to continue.]</string>
<string name="town1">You\'ve travelled for days, but your journey has just begun. At last, you stand before the world\'s top magic academy: The School of Thought.\n[Tap on a building to enter.]</string>
    <string name="academynag">Tap on the academy.</string>

    <string name="welcome">So you want to be a wizard? And partake in duels of sorcery? Then listen carefully...\n[Tap the screen to continue.]</string>
    <string name="howtoknife">Before any spells, you must learn to wield your <b>Knife</b>. Physical violence may be the last resort, but many a wizard owes their life to combat training. I will first teach you to <i>Stab</i>.\n[Tap the screen to continue.]</string>
    <string name="howtoknife2">Starting from the lower part of the screen, slide your finger up ( &#x2191; ).\n[Tap the screen to continue.]</string>
    <string name="howtoknifepass1">That\'s certainly a <b>Knife</b>! Do it again.\n[Tap to continue.]</string>
    <string name="howtoknifepass2">Gesturing on the left half of the screen gives a left-handed <i>Stab</i>, and the right half gives a right-handed <i>Stab</i>.\n[Tap to continue.]</string>
    <string name="howtoknifepass3">You show promise. Wait for me at the training hall.\n[Tap to continue.]</string>

<string name="jackwaitsatdummy">Jack awaits you at the training hall.</string>

    <string name="dummytut"><i>Stab</i> this wooden dummy 3 times to destroy it. Do the <b>Knife</b> motion (<b>K</b>), then tap the bottom of the screen.</string>
    <string name="dummytutwin">Well done. But let\'s see how you handle hostile targets.</string>
    <string name="dummytutdraw">Very funny, though strictly speaking you did destroy the dummy. You\'re lucky I know the Raise Dead spell.</string>
    <string name="dummytutlose">Very funny. You\'re lucky I know the Raise Dead spell. We\'ll move on, even though you lost to a wooden dummy.</string>
    <string name="dummytutskip">Clearly you know how to target your spells, so we\'ll skip a lesson. Train more on the dummy, If you like. Then see me back at school for your first magic lesson.</string>

    <string name="targettut">You must direct your first attacks to the goblins. Make a <b>Knife</b> gesture, then drag your finger from the <i>Stab</i> icon to a goblin. You must be precise.</string>
    <string name="targettutwin">You learn fast. Come see me at the school for your first magic lesson. Or stay awhile and smash a few more dummies.</string>
    <string name="targettutlose">You\'re lucky I know the <i>Raise Dead</i> spell. Let\'s try that again.</string>

    <string name="palmtut"><b>Palm</b> is a simple but powerful magical gesture.</string>
    <string name="palmtut1">Drag your finger downwards ( &#x2193; ) in the lower part of the screen to make the <b>Palm</b> gesture (<b>P</b>). </string>
    <string name="palmtutpass1">Good. In a duel, you could cast <i><i>Shield</i></i> now.</string>
    <string name="palmtutpass2">Great! <i>Shield</i> protects you from all physical attacks. Try <b>P</b> again.</string>
    <string name="palmtutpass3">Excellent! But beware! Gesturing <b>P</b> with both hands means you surrender!</string>
    <string name="palmtutpass4">Double <b>P</b> loses, unless your opponent dies.</string>
    <string name="palmtutpass5">Your first opponent awaits you at the Arena. See me once you\'ve won.</string>

<string name="duel1advice1">Cast <i>Shield</i> (<b>P</b>) to block stabs.</string>
<string name="duel1advice2">If you end up in trouble, surrender by gesturing <b>P</b> with both hands.</string>
<string name="duel1advice3">Good luck! See you after the duel!</string>

    <string name="arenashut">The Arena is closed.</string>

    <string name="SDtut0">Well fought! Let\'s pick up the pace.</string>
    <string name="SDtut">Do a <b>Snap</b> gesture (<b>S</b>) by drawing a diagonally up and away from the center, like a <b>Knife</b> gesture that veers outwards (L: &#x2196; R: &#x2197; ). Make <b>Snap</b> with both hands and end your turn.</string>
    <string name="SDtutpass1">Now, the <b>Digit</b> gesture (<b>D</b>) is the same except you go toward to center (L: &#x2197; R: &#x2196; ). Make <b>D</b> with both hands and end the turn.</string>
    <string name="SDtutpass2">Surprise! <b>S</b> then <b>D</b> casts <i>Missile</i>. Unlike <i>Shield</i>, most spells take several turns to cast.</string>
    <string name="SDtutpass3">At any time, press [MENU] to access your spellbook and review all you have learned so far.</string>
    <string name="SDtutpass4">Have fun! Come find me later.</string>
    <string name="SDtutwrong">That\'s not right. Let\'s start again.</string>

    <string name="talkabouttilt1">There\'s a showier way to cast spells than tapping the bottom of the screen.</string>
    <string name="talkabouttilt2">After gesturing, tilt the screen up vertically. When the bottom line flashes, tilt the screen back to its original position.</string>
    <string name="talkabouttilt3">You must have a gesture in each hand for this to work.</string>
    <string name="meetforwfp">Now, <i>Missile</i> is useful, but can be blocked by <i>Shield</i>. I\'ll teach you <i>Cause Light Wounds</i>, which deals 2 damage even to shielded targets. Meet me at the Training Hall.</string>

    <string name="wavetut">To make a <b>Wave</b> gesture (<b>W</b>), run your finger diagonally downwards and away from the center (L: &#x2199; R: &#x2198; ). <b>Wave</b> both hands and end your turn.</string>
    <string name="fingerstut">Now make the <b>Fingers</b> gesture (<b>F</b>) on both hands: run a finger diagonally downwards and towards the center (L: &#x2198; R: &#x2199; ). Then end your turn.</string>
    <string name="fingerstutpass1">Perfect! Gesture <b>Palm</b> with both hands. Normally this loses, but since <b>WFP</b> is <i>Cause Light Wounds</i>, you\'ll do 4 points of damage and kill your opponent!</string>
    <string name="fingerstutpass2">Well done! Notice a gesture can only complete 1 spell, explaining why no <i>Shield</i> was cast.</string>
    <string name="fingerstutpass3">I\'ll see you back at school.</string>
    <string name="fingerstutfail">Almost. Try again.</string>

    <string name="DSFteach1"><b>DSF</b> casts <i>Confusion</i>. The victim must gesture identically with both hands next turn.</string>
    <string name="DSFteach2">Observe a confused opponent who gestures <b>P</b> must do so with both hands, and thus surrenders!</string>
    <string name="DSFteach3">Remember, press [MENU] to review all you have learned. Now head to the Arena, where your next foe awaits.</string>

    <string name="duel2advice1">Recall <i>Shield</i> blocks <i>Stab</i> and <i>Missile</i>.</string>
    <string name="duel2advice2">To deal with <i>Shield</i>, try <i>Cause Light Wounds</i> (<b>WFP</b>). The <i>Confusion</i> spell (<b>DSF</b>) may also help. Good luck!</string>

<string name="cureteach1">Impressive! You\'re ready for more spells.</string>
<string name="cureteach2"><b>DFW</b> is <i>Cure Light Wounds</i>, which restores up to one point of health.</string>
<string name="cureteach3">And <b>SFW</b> is <i>Summon Goblin</i>, which summons a goblin to fight for you.</string>
<string name="cureteach4">You encountered two goblins before. Each has 1 point of health and attacks for 1 damage.</string>

<string name="generic_advice">Best of luck in your next battle!</string>

<string name="lvl1teach1">There are two more Level 1 spells.</string>
<string name="lvl1teach2"><b>WWP</b> is <i>Protection From Evil</i>. It acts as a Shield that lasts for 4 turns, including the turn it is cast.</string>
<string name="lvl1teach3"><b>PSDF</b> is <i>Charm Person</i>, which forces the opponent to make a gesture of your choice on one hand. It also cancels with <i>Confusion</i>.</string>
<string name="lvl1teach4">Your next challenger is waiting for you at the Arena.</string>
